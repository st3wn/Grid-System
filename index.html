I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

       <h3 class="item-3-heading">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
       <p class="item-3-text">  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
         professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
         student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
         did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
         project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
         could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
         experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
         100% recommend! ”</p>
